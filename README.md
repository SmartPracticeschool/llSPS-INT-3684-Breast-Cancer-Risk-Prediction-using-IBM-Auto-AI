# llSPS-INT-3684-Breast-Cancer-Risk-Prediction-using-IBM-Auto-AI

Breast Cancer Risk Prediction using IBM Auto AI. This project helps in predicting whether a tumour is present or not. It takes several parameters into consideration (Mean Radius, Mean Texture, Mean Perimeter, Mean Area and Mean Smoothness), which are eventually used to predict the outcome. Once the model is created, deploy and test it on Watson Studio. The output is then predicted by deploying the model in a web application built by using Node Red App Service present in IBM Cloud.
